On another side, the view of the college user, he can be known through the application and share his services to all the user of that. Between the task which that user can make the main one is adding rooms to the system.  Between the set of actions it finds communicate with all the student, who have a room of the college, see the incidences and update its status, see the information of the rooms and the students, also check if the students have made the payment of the month. 

The application can be reached from the web and it has a serve, what is getting through an API. The design of the web is responsive, it means that can be adapt to be display in different kind of devices such as desktop, tablet or mobile.
